1.	Write a program to input two numbers and display the highest number.

#include <stdio.h>
int main ()
{
    int no1,no2,max;

    printf ("Enter two numbers - ");
    scanf ("%d %d",&no1,&no2);

    if(no1>no2)
        printf ("The highest number is %d \n",no1);
    else
        printf ("The highest number is %d \n",no2);

}


2.	Write a complete program to ask user enter three integer numbers, and then tell the user the largest value and smallest value among the three numbers.

#include <stdio.h>
int main ()
{
    int no1,no2,no3,max,min;
    printf ("Enter the three integers - ");
    scanf ("%d %d %d",&no1,&no2,&no3);

    max=no1;
    min=no1;

    if (max<no2)
        max=no2;
    if (max<no3)
        max=no3;

    if (min>no2)
        min=no2;
    if (min>no3)
        min=no3;

    printf ("The highest value %d \n",max);
    printf ("The minimum value is %d \n",min);


}


3.	Display employee name, new salary, when the user inputs employee name, and basic salary. You can refer following formula and the table to calculate new salary: New Salary = Basic Salary + Increment Basic Salary Increment Less than 5000 5% of Basic Salary More than or equal 5000 and less than 10000 10% of Basic Salary More than or equal 10,000 15% of Basic Salary

{
  int bs,ns,inc;
  char name[20];

  printf ("Enter the name and salary - ");
  scanf ("%s %d",&name,&bs);

  if (bs<5000)
    inc=bs*5/100;
  else if (bs<10000)
        inc=bs*10/100;
  else
    inc=bs*15/100;

  ns=bs+inc;
  printf ("Employee name - %S \n",name);
  printf ("New salary - %d \n",ns);
}



 
4.	Diameter, Circumference and Area of a Circle) Write a program that reads in the radius of a circle and prints the circle’s diameter, circumference and area. Use the constant value 3.14159 for π. Perform each of these calculations inside the printf statement(s) and use the conversion specifier %f.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    float ra;
    printf ("enter the radius ");
    scanf ("%f",&ra);

    printf ("The diameter is %f \n",ra*2);
    printf ("The circumference is %f \n",2*3.143*ra);
    printf ("The area is %f \n",3.143*ra*ra);

}
 
5. Write a program that reads in two integers and determines and prints if the first is a multiple of the second.
#include <stdio.h>
int main ()
{
    int n1,n2;
    printf ("Enter the first Nmber - ");
    scanf("%d",&n1);
    printf ("Enter the second number - ");
    scanf ("%d",&n2);

    if(n1%n2==0)
    {
        printf ("%d is a multiple of %d",n1,n2);
    } else
    {
         printf("%d is not a multiple of %d",n1,n2);



 
5.	Write a C program that prints the integer equivalents of some uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits and special symbols. As a minimum, determine the integer equivalents of the following: A B C a b c 0 1 2 $ * + / and the blank character
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char x;

    printf ("Enter a Character among these: A,B,C,a,b,c,0,1,2,$,*,+,/ \n");
    scanf ("%c",&x);

    switch(x)
    {

    case 'A':printf("The Character code of A is 65");break;
    case 'B':printf("The Character code of B is 66");break;
    case 'C':printf("The Character code of C is 67");break;
    case 'a':printf("The Character code of a is 97");break;
    case 'b':printf("The Character code of b is 98");break;
    case 'c':printf("The Character code of c is 99");break;
    case '0':printf("The Character code of 0 is 48");break;
    case '1':printf("The Character code of 1 is 49");break;
    case '2':printf("The Character code of 2 is 50");break;
    case '$':printf("The Character code of $ is 36");break;
    case '*':printf("The Character code of * is 42");break;
    case '+':printf("The Character code of + is 43");break;
    case '/':printf("The Character code of / is 47");break;
    default:printf ("please type a given value");
    }

}
